"Manifesto: Having been been impressed with the running of the society this year, especially with the logistics for the trip to FOSDEM, I would love to take on this role. If elected, I intend to work with the current president on organizing FOSDEM. I also want to organize some more events (hopefully a hackathon and something for Varisty because we could actually beat Bangor at something). For those who don't know me, I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science student and next year will be my final year. I am known to be kind and approachable so please ask me questions!
