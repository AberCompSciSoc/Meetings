# Proposed Changes
Please list below any changes you would like discussed at the AGM. 

Please note, any proposed changes to the constitution must be submitted two 
weeks before the AGM (before 17th March).

## Changes to the Constitution

### Reformat Constitution to use LaTeX
Currently the constitiion is built on the word document template provided by
the SU, meaning that changes cannot be tracked on git. We propose the constition
should be written in LaTeX and the .tex and .pdf files should be held on git.

Proposed by: Lizzie (eas12)

### Add a mission for AberCompSoc
Currently there is no mission in our constitution. I propose the following 
to be our mission:

"To provide a community for students interested in computer science, and 
related fields."

Exact wording is open to discussion.

Proposed by: Lizzie Stone

### Remove all references to sports clubs 
The current constitution is made from a union template, and thus has irrelavent 
mentions of sports membership, specifically in 4.1 and 4.2.

Proposed by: Lizzie Stone
Seconded by:

### Update the list of committee positions 
Clause 5.1. I propose this should read:

"5.1) The Committee shall be made up of the following positions: President, Secretary, Treasurer and Social Secretary. Where deemed necessary, the following committee positions may also be held: Vice-President, Publicity Officer and another Social Secretary"

Proposed by: Lizzie Stone
Seconded by:

### Include date of AGM
There is currently a blank space where this should be specified. I propose 
the AGM is held on the last Friday of March each year (or a week before the 
Easter Holiday begins in the case that holiday begins in March).

Proposed by: Lizzie Stone
Seconded by:

### Update clause on minutes
Currently this says that minutes "shall be available through email to all members." We propose this should be changed to "shall be publicly available on github to all members."

Proposed by: Lizzie Stone
Seconded by:

### Update description of roles
Include descriptions of Publicity Officer and Vice-President (as set out in the current manifestos document), and improve the description of Social Secretary.

Proposed by: Lizzie Stone
Seconded by:

### Change title of document
Current title reads "Template: Constitution Societies & Sports 2016/17".
We propose this should be changed to "AberCompSoc Constitution 20??/??" where
?? should be replaced with the corresponding years. 

Proposed by: Lizzie Stone
Seconded by:

### Remove "the" as a precursor to AberCompSoc
In places we are referred to as "the AberCompSoc", and this is recorded in the constitution as our official name. We propose that this is changed to "AberCompSoc".

Proposed by: Lizzie Stone
Seconded by:

<!--- Example:
###Update aim of society
Currently there is no listed aim, this section is currently blank.
