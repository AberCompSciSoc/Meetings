# Proposed Changes
Please list below any changes you would like discussed at the AGM. 

Please note, any proposed changes to the constitution must be submitted two 
weeks before the AGM (before 17th March).

## Changes to the Constitution

### Reformat Constitution to use LaTeX
Currently the constitiion is built on the word document template provided by
the SU, meaning that changes cannot be tracked on git. We propose the constition
should be written in LaTeX and the .tex and .pdf files should be held on git.

Seconded by: Nick (ndr2)

### Add a mission for AberCompSoc
Currently there is no mission in our constitution. I propose the following 
to be our mission:

"To provide a community for students interested in computer science, and 
related fields."

Exact wording is open to discussion.

### Remove all references to sports clubs 
The current constitution is made from a union template, and thus has irrelavent 
mentions of sports membership, specifically in 4.1 and 4.2.

Proposed by: Lizzie (eas12)

Seconded by: Nick (ndr2)
             Aidan (aih16)

### Update the list of committee positions 
Clause 5.1. I propose this should read:

"5.1) The Committee shall be made up of the following positions: President, Secretary, Treasurer and Social Secretary. Where deemed necessary, the following committee positions may also be held: Vice-President, Publicity Officer and another Social Secretary"

### Include date of AGM
There is currently a blank space where this should be specified. I propose 
the AGM is held on the last Friday of March each year (or a week before the 
Easter Holiday begins in the case that holiday begins in March).

Proposed by: Lizzie (eas12)

Seconded by: Nick (ndr2)
             Aidan (aih16)

### Update clause on minutes
Currently this says that minutes "shall be available through email to all members." We propose this should be changed to "shall be publicly available on github to all members."

Proposed by: Lizzie (eas12)

Seconded by: Nick (ndr2)
             Aidan (aih16)

### Update description of roles
Include descriptions of Publicity Officer and Vice-President (as set out in the current manifestos document), and improve the description of Social Secretary.

Seconded by: Nick (ndr2)
             Aidan (aih16)

### Change title of document
Current title reads "Template: Constitution Societies & Sports 2016/17".
We propose this should be changed to "AberCompSoc Constitution 20??/??" where
?? should be replaced with the corresponding years.

### Remove "the" as a precursor to AberCompSoc
In places we are referred to as "the AberCompSoc", and this is recorded in the constitution as our official name. We propose that this is changed to "AberCompSoc".

Proposed by: Lizzie (eas12)

Seconded by: Nick (ndr2)

<!--- Example:
###Update aim of society
Currently there is no listed aim, this section is currently blank.

## Other Changes

### Remove the role of vice-president
Currently the committee consists of President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Social Secretaries (x2) and a Publicity Officer. Next year there will also be a Secretary. This is a very big committee for the size of active members. This encourages a culture of not helping out unless a person holds a role that specifically says they should. It also makes management much harder. The role of vice-president was only made to make up for an inactive Secretary. I propose the role of Vice-President is withdrawn for next year, and only brought back if it becomes apparent the role is needed.

### Remove the role of Publicity Officer
See reasons above for removal of Vice-President. With the role of Secretary being held by an active person next year, the role of Publicity Officer should not be needed. I propose the role of Publicity Officer is withdrawn for next year, and only brought back if it becomes apparent the role is needed.
