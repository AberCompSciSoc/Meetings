## Changes to the Constitution

<!--- Example:
###Update aim of society
Currently there is no listed aim, this section is currently blank.

Proposed by: Bob (abc12)
Seconded by: Alice (xyz89)

###Update Committee Positions
As of the incorporation of the CSTF: as discussed, the AberCompSoc should create a "CSTF Representative" position on the board. It would be perfect if this could be ready for voting on the 31. AGM. Additionally, this would come in hand with a change in the constitution, as it must be defined, that only registered members of the CSTF board may run for that position and that (whatever they are) the rules of the CSTF constitution must be followed during that process. 

Proposed by: Max Kossatz - President of the CSTF (mak72)
