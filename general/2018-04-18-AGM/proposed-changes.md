# Proposed Changes
Please list below any changes you would like discussed at the AGM. 

## Changes to the Constitution

### Remove Role of Social Secretaries
With little interest in socials explicitly organised and handled by the society this year it is proposed that the role of Social Secretary be removed and the socials allowed to return to the organic state they began in.

### Remove Role of Vice President
While useful the responsibilities of Vice President could be rolled into the functions of other committee members and enthusiastic members. It is therefore proposed that the role be removed to slim down the size of the committee.
