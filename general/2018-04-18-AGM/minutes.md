## Item 1 - Proposed Changes to Constitution

### Remove the role of Social Secretaries

*Comments:*
- Difficulties with availability of Social Secs at times, unable to run socials if they are not available
- In the past the socials have always been run organicly, not explicitly by the society
- Themed socials tended to drive members away
- Split the focus of the society from providing valuable events/trips/talks
**Passed**

### Remove role of Vice President

*Comments:*
- Contributes to making the size of the committee larger than it needs to be 
- Resposibilities are well covered by the other roles and should also be by enthusiastic members

**Passed**
