# FOSDEM 2019 Retrospective

### Advertising

* Overall the event was Advertised poorly
* FOSDEM should be Advertised to Freshers
* Attempt to get FOSDEM Pushed by the department
  * Make Posters
  * More Facebook advertising
  * Change background on IMPACS Computers

### Information Beforehand

* All information was shared well Beforehand
* Having information on the website was good

## Travel
### Minibus
* Minibus was good
* No hassle as with trains (e.g. multiple changes)
* Minibus was good price compared to trains
* Timings would have made trains inappropriate

### Aeroplane (Ryanair)

* Fine
* Good cost

### Shuttle
* Okay compared to going direct to Brussels
* Suitability comes down to price compared to flying directly

### Travel intercity

* Mobib basic cards work well with 10 voyage ticket - 72 Hour tickets could work for shorter trips

## Hotel (Meininger)

* Good price (20 Euro per night)
* Good Location
* Advertise Towel policy beforehand
* Advertise Hotel Tax beforehand
* Try and get rooms together
* Try and get 12 people and do one group booking (Simplify Checkin/out)
* No breakfast worked well - no everyone wanted breakfast

## Spare time
* Atomium was good!
* Friday volunteering was good!
* Lack of a schedule worked well - people could do their own thing

### Friday Beer
* Everyone enjoyed
* Token distribution worked well (one person buy for everyone else)

## FOSDEM
* Good talks
* Queue to get into rooms
* Bigger rooms for some talks - E.g. ML

## AOB
* Alumni outreach
* Try and get Aberystwyth FOSDEM T-Shirts
