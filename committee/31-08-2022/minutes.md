Hoodies will be ordered from same supplier as before (Ffigar) and Luke will be contacting them about removing the Students Union logo. Hoodies are to have names and roles printed on them.
First social will be held on Thursday 29th Sept. 2022 in The Royal Pier Snooker Bar with Gio, whilst Bradley will be meeting newcomers at the Stairs to Nowhere outside the Students Union to walk down the hill with. All members of committee are to be present, to allow in-person introductions and aid the Social Secretary. Gio will be sorting some name tags for people on the first/second social.
Some new socials will begin shortly after entering term time, to allow for non-drinking socials (e.g., going to see goats, coffee meets, gaming/game nights including board games, cinema trips, etc.). These will be looked into by Luke and Gio.
BCS will be emailed by Bradley about the society and how we would like to work with them.
Luke will be arranging to be in the welcome talks, and Bradley will be joining him. After the welcome talks we will organize some shifts for a virtual stall on discord.
A bank account for the society is to be opened by Tom, when heâ€™s back in Aberystwyth.
There will be more posts on the social media accounts, this will be done more often. There will also be posts about committee members made every couple of days and the committee members are to send their introduction and photos to the committee chat.
