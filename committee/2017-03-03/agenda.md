- Twitter
  - Add banner
  
- Changes to the AberCompSoc Image
   - Keep the logo as it is (Welsh Dragon and Curly Brackets) as everyone likes it, or create a design where the dragon has
   the same layout but looks mechanical (Robot Welsh Dragon)  
   - Should colours be changed to mix it up a bit and add variety? (Grey, Silver, Red, Green or others)
   - Society banner perhaps include a circuit, binary, humanoid robot, AI design or all (Need a graphics student to do this)

- Society Font Change 
   - Coda
   - Other?
   
- Information about the Society
  - Sort out committee members being shown up
  - More information on the Student Union website and social media so freshers can get a better understanding on what we do
  - Include information about CSTF 
  - Even though AberSailbot is completely separate from AberCompSoc, perhaps include it as some comp sci students may be 
  interested in it too
  
- Advertisement for Recruitment  
   - Aber Comp Sci
   - Twitter 
   - Others
   
- Committee Rules
  - Have to make sure that the society will function for a long time especially when current members leave in the future and
  new members take their place
  - First point to make, this is not personal to any member of AberCompSoc, everyone understands that they still have to 
  focus on their course but they also have to fulfil the role they selected  
  - Committee members not doing roles properly 
  - How long it should be before considering that the committee member is not suited for that position (1 or 2 weeks of 
  inactivity) 
  
- Society Meet-Ups 
  - To discuss projects 
  - Work on projects 
  - Hang out 
  
- Potential Projects 
  - Create an app and sell to gain income 
  - AberFPVDroneRacing 
  - AberRobotWars
  
- Fate of the mailing list
  - [This](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/abercompsoc) is still listed on the website as the official mailing list.
  - Not used for the year so far.
  
- Review Member level access to the GitHub
  - If projects within the society are intended to live in the society GitHub members should probably have write access and not have to go through comittee members to merge a pull request.
  - Certain repositiories should probably only have write access for committee members (e.g. official docs)
    - Could employ GitHub's Teams feature to provide correct access levels.
  - Members should probably be able to assign and label issues.
  - Aim for a situation where the committee only causes a bottleneck in workflow when official society documents, creating new repositories or teams, etc. are involved.
